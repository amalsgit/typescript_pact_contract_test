# Consumer Driven Contract Tests with Pact & TypeScript

This is a sample project to demonstrate consumer driven contract testing using the PACT framework and TypeScript.

This repo consists of a `provider service` and a `consumer service`. The interactions between these 2 services will be tested used PACT.

The `provider` service which is responsible for CRUD-ing & maintaining a movie database and the `consumer` service makes use of the APIs exposed by the `provider` to do further operations.

## Installation

`This project is written with Node version v12.18.4`

Install node

```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```

Install yarn

```
https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable
```

## Provider SetUp

Go to the provider directory

```
cd provider/
```

Run yarn to get all the required libraries

```
yarn
```

To run the provider server run

```
yarn start
```

This brings up the application at `http://localhost:3001` You can hit `http://localhost:3001/movies` to return a list of movies in the system

## Consumer SetUp

Go to the consumer directory

```
cd consumer/
```

Run yarn to get all the required libraries

```
yarn
```

## Running Consumer Contract Tests

Go to the consumer directory

```
cd consumer/
```

Run

```
yarn test
```

The above command runs the contract tests and generates the PACT contract file under the `contracts` directory

## Running Provider Contract Tests

Go to the provider directory

```
cd provider/
```

Before running the provider test, you need to bring up the provider server. You can do that by running

```
yarn start
```

Once the application is up run the tests using

```
yarn test
```

The above command picks up the PACT contract file from the `contracts` directory which was generated by the consumer contract tests and run the tests against the provider.
